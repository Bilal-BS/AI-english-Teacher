🔧 1. Check the API Prompt
Make sure the prompt you're sending to OpenAI clearly asks for correction and reply. It should look like this:

ts
Copy
Edit
const prompt = `
You are an English tutor. Your job is to:
1. Correct any grammar or spelling mistakes in the user's input.
2. Then reply naturally like in a conversation.

Use this format:
Corrected: <corrected input>
Reply: <natural reply>
`;
Don’t just send the raw user message. Append the user input to the prompt like this:

ts
Copy
Edit
const fullPrompt = `${prompt}\n\nUser: ${userInput}`;
🧠 2. Parse the AI Response Correctly
Ensure your code extracts both Corrected: and Reply: from the response:

ts
Copy
Edit
const lines = aiResponse.split('\n');
const correctedLine = lines.find(line => line.startsWith("Corrected:"))?.replace("Corrected:", "").trim();
const replyLine = lines.find(line => line.startsWith("Reply:"))?.replace("Reply:", "").trim();
✅ Then display both in your component.

💬 3. Frontend Display Check
Make sure the correctedLine is not being hidden or overwritten. Here’s a working JSX snippet:

tsx
Copy
Edit
{corrected && (
  <div className="mb-2 text-green-700">
    <strong>Corrected:</strong> {corrected}
  </div>
)}
{reply && (
  <div className="mb-2 text-blue-700">
    <strong>Reply:</strong> {reply}
  </div>
)}
🔐 4. OpenAI Response Consistency
Sometimes OpenAI might skip Corrected: if not forced. You can enforce response formatting like this:

ts
Copy
Edit
const systemMessage = {
  role: "system",
  content: "You are a helpful English tutor. Always correct grammar/spelling and then reply like a conversation partner. Use this exact format:\nCorrected: ...\nReply: ..."
};
🧪 5. Example Working Request (Full)
ts
Copy
Edit
const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({
  model: "gpt-4",
  messages: [
    systemMessage,
    { role: "user", content: `He go to market yestarday.` }
  ],
  temperature: 0.6
});
Expected Response:

vbnet
Copy
Edit
Corrected: He went to the market yesterday.
Reply: That sounds nice! What did he buy from the market?
✅ Final Suggestion
If you want, paste your OpenAI call function and how you're parsing the result, and I can quickly correct it for you.

Let me know your setup (React, Next.js, Replit, etc.) and I’ll tailor it exactly.
