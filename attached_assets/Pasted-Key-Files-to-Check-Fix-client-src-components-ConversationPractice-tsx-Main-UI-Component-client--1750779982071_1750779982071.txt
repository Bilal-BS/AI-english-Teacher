Key Files to Check & Fix
client/src/components/ConversationPractice.tsx ✅ Main UI Component

client/src/utils/openaiService.ts ✅ OpenAI integration

server/openaiService.ts ✅ (may be a backend version)

I’ll now inspect the content of ConversationPractice.tsx to:

Identify bugs

Confirm if auto-correction and conversation logic are wired properly

Apply any fixes needed

Starting with that now. 

The ConversationPractice.tsx file looks well-structured, and it includes:

✅ Support for corrections and autoCorrection

✅ Integration with openaiService

✅ A messages array that handles role, content, timestamp, and corrections

However, if auto-correction is not working, likely problems are:

❌ The openaiService is not returning autoCorrection properly

❌ The frontend is not parsing/extracting correction data from OpenAI response

❌ You may be calling OpenAI with a weak or unclear prompt

Next, I’ll review the openaiService.ts file in /client/src/utils/ to confirm how the API call is made, and if it's returning grammar corrections properly. 

It seems like I can’t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

However, based on what we’ve already seen in your ConversationPractice.tsx, the auto-correction system is designed correctly, but it's likely failing because your OpenAI service (openaiService.ts) is not parsing the corrections properly.

✅ What You Should Check in openaiService.ts
Please open the file client/src/utils/openaiService.ts and check:

1. Is your OpenAI prompt clear?
It must request correction in a structured format. Example:

ts
Copy
Edit
const prompt = `
You are an English tutor. When the user sends a message:
1. Correct grammar/spelling.
2. Reply naturally like in a conversation.

Respond in this format:
Corrected: <corrected sentence>
Reply: <conversation reply>
`;
2. Is your code extracting the correction?
You must parse the response like this:

ts
Copy
Edit
const corrected = responseText.match(/Corrected:\s*(.+)/i)?.[1]?.trim();
const reply = responseText.match(/Reply:\s*(.+)/i)?.[1]?.trim();
Then return this as part of the message:

ts
Copy
Edit
return {
  role: 'assistant',
  content: reply,
  autoCorrection: {
    originalText: userInput,
    correctedText: corrected,
    hasErrors: corrected !== userInput,
    corrections: [{
      original: userInput,
      corrected: corrected,
      explanation: "Auto-corrected by AI.",
      type: "grammar"
    }],
    encouragement: "Good try!",
    grammarScore: 85,
  }
};
✅ Action You Can Take Now
Open client/src/utils/openaiService.ts in Replit.

Replace or improve the OpenAI request with the above example.

Make sure the returned object includes autoCorrection.
